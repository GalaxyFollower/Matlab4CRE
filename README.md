Matlab4CRE
==========

Collection of Matlab codes to solve typical CRE (Chemical Reaction Engineering) problems

Usage
-----
Before running the codes (described in the following), remember to add the `kinetics` folder to MATLAB search path using the command `addpath`. As an example:
```
addpath('C:\Teaching\Chemical Reaction Engineering\Matlab4CRE\kinetics')
```
Description
-----------
The MATLAB codes are organized in the following folders:

1. `kinetics`: classes to manage kinetic mechanism (together with thermoynamic data and transport properties)

2. `simulation`: codes for simulating tubular reactors and transient, perfectly stirred reactors

3. `regressions`: examples of regression analysis to evaluate kinetic parameters in batch reactors

4. `design`: codes to size ideal reactors in isothermal conditions

5. `exercises`: excercises from Fogler (Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering, 4th Edition) and Levenspiel (Chemical Reaction Engineering, 3rd Edition)

6. `reactive_distillation`: example of reactive ditillation coupled to semi-batch reactor

7. `practicals`: exercises proposed in the practical sessions of Chemical Reaction Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano
